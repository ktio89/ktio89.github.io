Hello. I am Kai (翁子洋), from Taipei, Taiwan. I am an `AI researcher`, currently pursing a Ph.D. under the supervision of prof. [Jinyoung Yeo](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/). ​​Before AI & CS, I'd studied `mechanical engineering` at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about/about.html) (B05) and [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp).
I've always been so enthralled by how we can draw inspiration from both `societal challenges` we're facing and `human behaviours` (e.g., cognitive theory) to drive the advancement of AI. Consequently, my research interest lies in the intersection of:
- Language Agents
- Human-centred AI
- AI for Science and Social Good (e.g., healthcare)
- Dialogue / Interactive Systems

`I'll be attending CHI (Yokohama, Japan) and NAACL (Albuquerque, USA)!`
