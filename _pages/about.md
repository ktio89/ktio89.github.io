Hello. I am Kai, from Taiwan. I am a `Ph.D. candidate in AI` (advised by prof. [Jinyoung Yeo](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/)). ​​Before AI & CS, I'd studied mechanical engineering at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about/about.html) (B05) and [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp).
I am enthralled by how we can draw inspiration from both `societal challenges we're facing` and `human behaviours` (e.g., cognitive theory) to drive the advancement of AI. Consequently, my research interest lies in the intersection of:
- Dialogue / Interactive Systems[<sup>1</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10996)
- Language Agents[<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13232)
- Human-centred AI 
- AI for Science and Social Good (e.g., healthcare)[<sup>3</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07399)<sup>,</sup>[<sup>4</sup>](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2793342)

`I am currently serving in the Taiwan army (- 2026 Q1) as a rifleman and signaller (radio).`
